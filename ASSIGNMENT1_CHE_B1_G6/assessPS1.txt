Overview:
The running time assessment of a program gives an overall impression about the programs complexity 
with respect to the time and space utlization. A program may contains different functional operations and their relevant
algorithms to implement the desired functionalities. Assessing a program with respect to temporal and spatial complexity will
give an indicative impression about the complex nature of the operations that the program carries out. 

Here, the program for employee attendance system's important operations and algorithms hav been undergone a complexity analysis with standard methods(Random Access Model and Primitive counting).
The complexity of the running time and space utilization have been represented in Asymptotic notations such as Big-oh, Big-Theta and Big-Omega.
