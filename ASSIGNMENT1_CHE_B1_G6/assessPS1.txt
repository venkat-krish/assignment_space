Overview:
The running time assessment of a program gives an overall impression about the programs complexity 
with respect to the time and space utilization. A program may contains different functional operations and their relevant
algorithms to implement the desired functionalities. Assessing a program with respect to temporal and spatial complexity will
give an indicative impression about the complex nature of the operations that the program carries out. 

Here, the program for employee attendance system's important operations and algorithms hav been undergone a complexity analysis with standard methods(Random Access Model and Primitive counting).
The complexity of the running time and space utilization have been represented in Asymptotic notations such as Big-oh, Big-Theta and Big-Omega. 

Assessment:

1. How many employees came today?

  Method		: _getHeadCountRec
  Running Time	: O(1)
  Explanation 	: in BST implementation we have used a reference variable 'size'
				  Which will be incremented for each insert of new node and
				  it will represent the overall size of the BST tree
				  Hence we can get headcount info on constant time O(1)

2. Did a particular employee come today?

  Method		: _searchIDRec
  Running Time	: O(n)  - n is size of the tree,
                  more precisely its O(h) , h - height of the tree

  Explanation 	: in BST search implementation number of iteration depends on the height of the tree h,
                  in case of a skewed tree height = size - 1, hence running time is O(n), precisely O(h)
				  n = size of tree and h= height of tree


3. How often did an employee enter into the office?

  Method		: _howOftenRec
  Running Time	: O(n)  - n is size of the tree,
                  more precisely its O(h) , h - height of the tree

  Explanation 	: Since each node has a visit counter in place,
				  running time depends on the search functionality, hence its O(n)


4. Which employee moves out of office the greatest number of times?

  Method		: _frequentVisitorRec
  Running Time	: O(n)  - n is size of the tree, (independent of tree height)


  Explanation 	: Max node is computed by visiting all the nodes once,
                  by computing max for each child subtree and rolling up to root level for over all max


5. Which employee ids within a range of IDs attended office, the attendance counter for them, and
whether they are inside or outside office?

  Method		: _printRangePresent
  Running Time	: O(n)  - n is size of the tree  - in terms of tree size
                  Amortized analysis would have a better running representation
                  as we are limiting the number of iteration based on range


  Explanation 	: In order traversal with Range bound was used in implementation


Conclusion:
  Over all performance depends on two inputs given to the program
  1) Employee visit records , which is used to form the BST tree
      Running time : - O(n^2) - since its repeated insert operation
                       n = number of rows in inputPS1.txt file

  2) Number of operations given in promptsPS1.tx file
     Running time :  Since the max running time of all given set of operations is O(n) , n = size of the tree
                     running r operations on worst case would take
                     O(r * n)
                          r = number of operations given in promptsPS1.txt
                          n = size of the tree
  over all worst case running time will be : O( max(n,r)^2)
                                                  n = number of rows in inputPS1.txt
                                                  r = number of operations on promptsPS1.txt
